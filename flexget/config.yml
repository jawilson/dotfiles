# Flexget (http://www.flexget.com) configuration file.
#
# Created by: Jeff Wilson <jeff@jeffalwilson.com>
# Available from: https://github.com/atlanta800/dotfiles
#
# Some settings in this config require changes in my fork of Flexget which
# is available here: https://github.com/atlanta800/Flexget
#
# For various reasons I've moved some settings into a private subfolder. The
# files are:
#   * private/global.yml
#   * private/movies-global.yml
#   * private/tv-global.yml
# These files are not necessary to use this cofiguration, simply remove the
# 'include' plugin references and you should be fine. You'll also want to check
# for a few places that I've commented out sections that I've moved to these
# config files. I've also added redacted versions of the private files to
# reference if you'd like to do the same.
#
# == Rar-unpacking ==
# My entire setup results in a single video file (.mkv, .mp4, etc) in the final
# destination with a nice name regardless if it's packed in a rar or not.
# Here's the gist of how it works:
#   1. Flexget accepts the torrent regardless if it's a rar-pack or not
#   2. My custom content_sort plugin changes the move_done value if the torrent
#       contains a .rar
#   3. The torrent is added to Deluge
#   4. Deluge is configured with the Execute (http://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/Plugins/Execute)
#       plugin to run my deluge_torrent_complete script (also available in this
#       repository) when any torrent is done downloading
#   5. deluge_torrent_complete checks if the torrent is located in the
#       directory we set in step #2, if not it skips to the last step
#   6. deluge_torrent_complete unpacks the first .rar file it finds in the
#       torrent to a 'staging' location
#   7. deluge_torrent_complete calls flexget with a completely separate config,
#       'sorting.yml' (also available in this repository)
#   8. The 'sorting.yml' config checks for files in the 'staging' location from
#       step #6 and renames and moves the files to their appropriate final
#       location
#   9. deluge_torrent_complete tells my XBMC server to update the library (scan
#       for new files)
